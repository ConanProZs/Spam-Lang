# Spam-Lang
 Spamming Language created using Python


## requirements
- python
- needed libraries
## about
this is technically a progamming language
created just for spamming
## how it works & usage
Its a interpreted language, so to run it you first need a file `example.fsp` then run it `python spam-lang.py run/example.fsp`.
But you can compile it to python by running `python spamc.py run/example.fsp` and it creates a example.fsp.py but you can rename it
